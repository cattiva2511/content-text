	At seventy three I can understand:
	every beginning has also an end
	and everything has to finish in time,
	but like my verse, with a beautiful rhyme.

	At seventy three I know well,
	it’s time for a dignified farewell;
	The naked truth I can boldly face:
	I’ll be remembered no more than three days.

	At seventy three I don’t have wealth,
	but I am still fit, in good mental health;
	I’d like to be free and to enjoy life,
	before start wetting and lose sex drive.

	At seventy three, My Lord, it’s high time
	to leave, before I’m kicked out in the grime!
