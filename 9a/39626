	Last night a little bird came to my place
	and said: „Dear friend, bear in mind,
	something behind you is gathering pace…
	Be more alert and stop being blind!

	Just look around and guess: somebody nice,
	(young doctor) that you know well,
	is trying F-party to organize —
	you know… I mean… A Farewell!

	You stated unwisely, my dear friend,
	that in six months your employment will end.
	Who is revealing things of that kind!

	Anyway! Don’t even think!… It’s not true,
	that they are rushing to get rid of you,
	before, by chance, you change your mind“.
