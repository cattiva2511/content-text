	Another day, when the governor was present in _darbár_, two men came and presented their petitions. They both claimed a certain foal. It was a very curious case. According to the custom of the country, they, being townsmen, had sent their ponies (mares) to the hills to graze. Both of the mares were with young, and while they were in the shepherd’s charge gave birth to two foals, one of which was stillborn and the other lived. However, the living colt sucked milk from both. The shepherd was not present at the time of its birth, and therefore when he came and saw this he could not tell to which mare the colt belonged. Of course, when the season was over and the owners came for their ponies, both of them claimed the colt; and as neither of them seemed inclined to give way to the other, they went to the court about it.
	After a little deliberation the governor ordered the men to take both the ponies and the colt down to the water, and to put the colt into a boat and paddle out into the middle of the river. “The mother of the colt,” said he, “will swim after it; but the other pony will remain on the bank.” Thus was the case decided.
