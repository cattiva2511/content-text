	The human being shares common features
	with thousand of living earthy creatures;
	His organs, systems and skeletal frame
	in structure and in functions are the same.

	He’s making love… He sleeps, and drinks, and eats,
	and often does shameful and beasty deads.
	He can not fly, cos doesn’t have wings,
	but like a birdie beautifully sings.

	His brain’s the only thing of different kind —
	It’s developed an unique human mind.
	But an instinct, blessed with an intellect,
	more dangerously than a beast can act.

	Oh, dear Lord, with your might divine
	a monster you’ve created — Frankenstein!
