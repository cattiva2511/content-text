	Look around yourself.
	Falling down again,
	Asking for a little love,
	But nothing good is done.

	Once again you’re lovelorn,
	You want to be unborn.
	Falling down again,
	Feeling terrible pain.

	You are desperated,
	You are desolated.
	Falling down again
	What is your gain?

	Your soul can’t be solaced,
	Your dreams are devastated.
	Falling down again,
	You will not regain.

	Love destructed your soul,
	You are in the mould.
	You were asking for a little love,
	But nothing good was done.
