	Asleep alone, with no one in my arms to see
	I throw myself with eyes wide closed
	For you I search for, in the dark to be
	And yet you’re in the dark indeed.

	I seize the day, the light my sacred dream
	I long for you, the beauty is supreme
	but I awake and you — nowhere to find
	the trap awaiting in the blind
	the trap so deeply dug with hands and art
	which shaped, took over and destroyed my heart

	Again alone, the room is silent and exposed
	Again afraid, the nightmare climbing on my tree
	I throw myself with eyes wide closed
	Asleep alone, with no one in my arms to see.
