	My breath should be your blanket,
	my thought should be a hand
	that keeps you warm and fed
	and guards you through the night.

	My eyes should be the stars,
	my thought should be a flow
	in which you heal your scars,
	in which you find your home.

	My kiss you should accept,
	my dream you should invade
	in which you neatly slept,
	till my kiss makes you wakeâ€¦
