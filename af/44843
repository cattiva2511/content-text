	There is a saying in Srinagar-City, "Rupees come to rupees," which is equivalent to the English, "Money makes money."
	Once upon a time a stupid peasant heard this saying, and understanding it literally, went to a money-changer's shop, where he saw two or three piles of silver and copper, and put a rupee in one of the chinks of the wall, saying,
	"Come, come, rupees, to my rupee."
	In his excitement the foolish man put the rupee in so far that it tumbled down inside the shop, and was counted among the money-changer's money, whereupon he wept and went home.
	Some time afterwards he met the person who had quoted the saying to him, and told him how he had proved the falsity of it.
	"Not at all," said the man. "I spoke correctly. Your rupee went to the money-changer's rupees. They, being the more, had the greater power."
