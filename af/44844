	It was in the month of October, when a man from the villages came to the city to sell his cotton. It was his first visit. As he walked through the _bázár_ he noticed the goldsmiths constantly putting gold ornaments into the fire, and then selling them directly afterwards. Thought he, “There must be some trick in this. I will do the same. Why should I wander all over the place to sell my cotton when I can thus command purchasers?” So he went to a blacksmith’s shop and threw his basket of cotton into the furnace, and then waited. Of course the cotton was destroyed*.
