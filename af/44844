	It was in the month of October, when a man from the villages came to the city to sell his cotton. It was his first visit. As he walked through the bazar he noticed the goldsmiths constantly putting gold ornaments into the fire, and then selling them directly afterwards. Thought he,
	"There must be some trick in this. I will do the same. Why should I wander all over the place to sell my cotton when I can thus command purchasers?"
	So he went to a blacksmith's shop and threw his basket of cotton into the furnace, and then waited. Of course the cotton was destroyed.
