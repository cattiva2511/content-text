	„I remember that wonderful moment…“
@	A. S. Pushkin
E$

	I saw a girl with eyes like crystal beads,
	so innocent and pure as can be kids;
	with rounded shapes and an angel face —
	half-woman, half-child with beauty and grace.

	Holding a lighter, her hand tender, nice
	skillfully lit it to my great surprise,
	and in clouds of smoke her angel face,
	I saw how vanished without a trace!
