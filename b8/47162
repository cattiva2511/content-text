	Tigers at first were ignorant, until the king of the tigers once came to the cat and begged him for lessons. The cat, consenting, taught the tiger to watch, to crouch, to spring, and all the other accomplishments so famihar to the race. At last, when he thought he had learnt everything the cat had to impart, the tiger made a spring at his teacher, intending to tear him and eat him. Instantly the cat ran nimbly up a tree, whither the tiger was unable to follow.
	‘Come down!’ cried the tiger, ‘come down instantly!’ 
	‘No, no!’ replied the cat. ‘How fortunate for me that I did not teach you more! Otherwise you would have been able to pursue me even here.’
